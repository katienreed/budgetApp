# budgetApp

##Synoposis
This application receives a user's input of an annual income, and then makes estimated suggestions of how that money should be allocated annually.  It is supported by data visualization in the form of a chart.  The rendered data can be updated in real time when one changes the income variable without refreshing.

##Motivation
I want to better understand javascript libraries and frameworks.  I figured Backbone.js would be a good starting point because of the surplus of clear documentation and community support.

##Todo
1. Expense Categories
* Build a model and a corresponding view

2. Income Submit
* Build a model and a corresponding view

3. Pie Chart
* Attach d3.js and High Charts to application
